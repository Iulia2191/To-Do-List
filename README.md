ChoreMaster is a web application that I developed during the Web Development course at IT School. This project is designed to help users manage their daily chores and to-do lists more efficiently. The chore list is dynamically fetched from an external API, providing real-time data for users.


Technologies Used:
React,
React Router,
React Bootstrap,
State management with React Context and Reducer,
REST API integration for chore data,
CSS Modules for styling.
